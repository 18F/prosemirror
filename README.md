# ProseMirror

This is to be a well-behaved what-you-see-is-what-you-mean editor
based on contentEditable, with support for collaborative editing and
customizable document models.

There isn't much documentation yet, because everything is being
rewritten twice per week. Here's a rough overview of the source
directories (which may go out of date):

```
src/
  model/      The document model
  transform/  Operations on the document model
  edit/       The editor
  collab/     Collaborative editing module
  inputrules/ Magic input (-- → —) module
  markdown/   Converting the document model from and to Markdown
  menu/       Menu UI modules
```

To try the editor, run

```
npm install
npm run demo
```

And point your browser at /checkout/dir/demo/index.html
